Depending on your Masters degree, you may have online lectures, seminars and&nbsp;guided independent reading. You can connect with your classmates or contact your course tutors with any questions as you study.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div data-behaviour=accordion >
				<h3>How much time you will need to complete an online Masters degree</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The length of study depends on each individual online Masters course. A full postgraduate degree could take 1-2 years or longer.&nbsp;You will find the duration of your course clearly stated on your chosen course page.</p>
<p>Part-time online courses typically require 10-20 hours per week, while full-time courses require a full-time commitment of around 40 hours per week.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div data-behaviour=accordion >

				<h3>Flexibility</h3>
				<div>
					<p>University of Stirling online&nbsp;postgraduate degrees are incredibly flexible. You can study the learning material anywhere in the world, at a time that suits you.</p>
<p>Most of our online Masters courses&nbsp;have live sessions. You should attend these to make the most of your course, but most sessions will be recorded if you need to catch up.</p>
<p>Our courses are structured around self-paced study with occasional assessment and assignment deadlines to ensure you keep making progress.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div data-behaviour=accordion >
				<h3>Meeting other students online</h3>

			<div data-behaviour=accordion >
				<h3>Your graduation</h3>
				<div>

			<div data-behaviour=accordion >
				<h3>A recognised online university qualification</h3>
				<div>
					<p>All our online postgraduate degrees are delivered by qualified academics, with the same attention to detail and quality that you would expect from our on-campus courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having an online postgraduate degree will boost your CV just the same as a "traditional" on-campus qualification.</p>
